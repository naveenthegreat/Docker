# Day 03 - Docker Flask App 

This is my third day learning Docker.  
In this project, I created a simple Flask app with two routes and ran it inside a Docker container.


## What I Did

- Wrote a Python Flask app with `/` and `/hello` routes
- Created a `Dockerfile` to build a custom image
- Used `requirements.txt` to install Flask inside the container
- Exposed port 5000 to access the app in 


## Access the App

Since Iâ€™m running this in a VirtualBox VM, I used the VM IP (from `ip a`) to open in browser:
- http://<vm-ip>:5000/
- http://<vm-ip>:5000/hello
It worked perfectly after setting `host='0.0.0.0'` in the Flask app.


## What I Learned

- How to use `requirements.txt` in Docker
- How to expose and map ports correctly
- Difference between `docker run` in foreground and detached mode
- Why `host='0.0.0.0'` is important inside Docker
